title: Why I started this blog
---

I'm doing this blog as part of preperation for the Masters of Data Science course at the University of British Columbia. The course load will be quite heavy, but thankfully lots of the courses have notes and labs available online. Right now I'm doing as much as I can so that I'm ahead when the program begins. 

I'm in this program because I want to use data science for the good of people and the planet. There are so many powerful tools that data enables. I want to leverage these tools to makes lives better and take care of our planet.
